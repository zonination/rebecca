* **Source: Google Trends**
* **Tool: R/ggplot2**

All code and data files [are present on this github page](https://github.com/zonination/rebecca).

Google tends to smooth/group their plots in large overviews, so in order to get date granularity, I had to export [custom dates](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2014-01-01%202014-07-01&q=rebecca%20black) in 6-month increments. I also had to scale the individual files since the index on the trends page auto-scales to 0-100.
